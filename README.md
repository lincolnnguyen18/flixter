### Notes
Imported Alamofire instead of AlamofireImage. Wasted a bit of time on figuring that out but otherwise not too challenging so far. Interacting with the API and seeing the movies show up was fun though.

Update: Pulling from git in xcode reset my whole project. Had to redo. This was the biggest challenge I faced.
